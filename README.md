# Abstract

Ejector is one of the widely used devices in the industry, which is used in a wide range of oil and gas, aerospace, propulsion production, fuel cell, refrigeration systems and solar power technology industries. Ejector is a process pressure injection device that takes advantage of the effects of variable pressure flow.

One of the important applications of the surface jet pump in the oil and gas industry is to transfer the flow of wells that have been harvested for a long time and need to generate additional flow due to pressure drop. Ejector is used as one of the solutions to increase pressure and transfer flow in these wells. Also, the ejector is also used in the operation of the gas extraction valve, where the need to inject the reactive substance is felt to improve the performance and separate the gases.

In this project, a new software package will be developed to design the operating conditions of the ejector. This software package will help engineers and designers in the oil and gas industry to create optimal operating conditions for ejectors using advanced methods and accurate simulations. In this way, better performance of ejectors and reduction of operating costs in the oil and gas industry will be achieved. Using this software package will improve the performance of ejectors, increase productivity and reduce costs in the oil and gas industry.
